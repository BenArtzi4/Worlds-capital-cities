# World Capital Cities Program

Welcome to the World Capital Cities program, written in Python!

This program creates a map of the countries of the world and marks the location of the capital of each country, along with its name. The capital cities are also color coded based on their population size:

* Under 50,000 residents: green color
* Between 50,000 and 100,000 residents: orange color
* Over 100,000 residents: red color

## To use the World Capital Cities program:

1. Download the program files and open them in a Python development environment.
2. Run the program to download a zip file from the internet and extract the Excel file containing city data from all over the world.
3. The program will filter the data to only include capital cities and plot them on a map based on their longitude and latitude.
4. The capital cities will be color coded based on their population size as described above.

I hope this program helps you visualize the locations and populations of the capital cities of the world!
