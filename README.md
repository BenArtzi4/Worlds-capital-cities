# World Capital Cities Program

Welcome to the **World Capital Cities** program, a Python application designed to generate an interactive map showcasing the capitals of the world, color-coded by population size.

## Overview

This Python script creates an interactive map using Folium, visualizing each capital city with its name and population. The map is color-coded to indicate population sizes, providing a clear and visually appealing representation of global capitals.

## Features

- **Color Coding**: Capitals are color-coded based on their population:
  - **Green**: Under 500,000 residents
  - **Orange**: 500,000 to 1,000,000 residents
  - **Red**: Over 1,000,000 residents

## Instructions

1. **Download** the program files from the repository.
2. **Install Required Libraries**: Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
   - `requests`
   - `pandas`
   - `folium`
   
   You can install them using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install requests pandas folium
   ```
   3. **Run the Script**: Execute the provided Python script to generate the interactive map. You can run the script from the command line or your preferred Python IDE:

    ```
     python mymapproject.py
    ```

## Generated File

- **Output File**: The script will generate an HTML file named `Map3.html`.

## Viewing the Map

1. **Locate the File**: After running the script, you will find the `Map3.html` file in the same directory where the script was executed.
2. **Open the File**: Double-click the `Map3.html` file, or open it with a web browser of your choice (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

   The map will load in your browser, displaying the interactive map with capital cities color-coded by population. You can click on the markers to view information about each capital city.
